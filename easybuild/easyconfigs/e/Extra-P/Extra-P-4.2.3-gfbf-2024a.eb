description = """
Extra-P is an automatic performance-modeling tool that supports the user in the identification of scalability bugs.
Extra-P uses measurements of various performance metrics at different execution configurations as input to generate
performance models of code regions (including their calling context) as a function of the execution parameters.
All it takes to search for scalability issues even in full-blown codes is to run a manageable number of small-scale
performance experiments, launch Extra-P, and compare the asymptotic or extrapolated performance of the worst
instances to the expectations.
